# Twitter Contest V1 (AKA BirdStick)
BirdStick is a tool and competition to help people tweet consistently.

### Contest description
During the contest registration, people can join by entering a stake and protocol fee. Once the competition starts, they must tweet during each 24 hour window thereafter, until the contest ends. If they break their tweeting streak during the contest (don't tweet during one of the 24hr windows), their stake is in jeopardy. Other contestants report anyone who fails to maintain their tweeting streak. They do so using a Tellor Protocol oracle. Once reported to Tellor, anyone can call the contest function to divy up the loser's stake amongst the contestants still in the running. Funds can be withdrawn from the contract once the competition ends.
